# Prediction with Regression: A Data-Driven Approach using KNN Regression.

# Introduction:
- The increasing popularity of iPhone purchases has prompted stores to explore predictive analytics to anticipate customer behavior.
- As the real estate market in Bangalore evolves, predicting house prices becomes crucial for both buyers and sellers.

# Aim of Project
-  This project aims to predict whether a customer will purchase an iPhone from a store based on demographic factors such as gender, age, and salary.
-   The predictive model developed here can offer valuable insights for targeted marketing
-   This project endeavors to predict house prices in Bangalore based on relevant features, providing valuable insights for real estate stakeholders.

# Methodology:  

### Data Collection:
- Gathered a dataset with customer information, including gender, age, salary, and a binary target variable indicating iPhone purchase.
  
### Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions.
- Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

### Model Selection and Training:
- Selected a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression).
- Trained the model on the training dataset.

### Evaluation:
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared and confusion matrix on the testing set.
- Fine-tuned hyperparameters to enhance performance.

### Prediction:
- Applied the trained model to predict iPhone purchases for new customers.
- Applied the trained model to predict house prices for new data.

# Challenges Faced:
- Dealing with imbalanced data.
- Addressing non-linearity in house price determinants
- Handling potential outliers in the salary data.
- Balancing model simplicity with accuracy.

# Conclusion:
- The developed model successfully predicts whether a customer will purchase an iPhone based on their gender, age, and salary. The insights gained from this project can guide stores in formulating targeted strategies for enhancing iPhone sales.
- The regression model provides a reliable prediction of house prices in Bangalore, aiding both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

# Result:
- Achieved an accuracy of [0.27466] on the test set.
- Achieved a R-squared value  [0.33].
